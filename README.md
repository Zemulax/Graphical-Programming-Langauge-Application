# MyAssignment


This is my assignment that I undertook in third year at uni.
It was all about creating a program that behaved like a progamming language with sequene and iteration.
Users would type syntax to cause the program to draw lines on a canvas

The concepts were:
1. Variables: the program would allow variables to be used in a loop and as parameters to draw commands
2. Loop Commands would repeat everything inside the block
3. if statements: would behave like proper if statements with a termination
4. syntax cheking: the syntax of the program would be checked before the program was run and reports generated
5. methods: this was a tough one but a method would be created and be called
A design pattern was implemented
